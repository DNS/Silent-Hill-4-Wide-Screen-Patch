P.S.:
On some systems, even though you meet the requirements to play the game it won't run.
To bypass this initial check, simply open the folder where the game is installed
(Default C:\Program Files\Konami\Silent Hill 4\)
and rename CheckSpec.dll to something else like CheckSpec.dll.bak or delete the file.
